    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "Now you have a range of `k` to investigate. Is 1 feature best? 2? 3? 4? All of them? You could write a for loop and iterate over each possible value, doing all the housekeeping yourselves to track the best value of k. But this is  a common task so there's a built in function in `sklearn`. This is [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).\n",
    "This takes the pipeline object, in fact it takes anything with a `.fit()` and `.predict()` method. In simple cases with no feature selection or imputation or feature scaling etc. you may see the classifier or regressor object itself directly passed into `GridSearchCV`. The other key input is the parameters and values to search over. Optional parameters include the cross-validation strategy and number of CPUs to use."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "At first, I took the average price (the training set mean) as my prediction and got an R-squared of zero on the training set. Then I used the same training set mean to predict unseen values from the test set and get a negative R-squared. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of how ‘close’ my predictions are to the true value, I calculated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and found that performance on a test set is slightly worse than on the training set. The predicted price might be off by around $19 on the test set. However, Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set is slightly better than on the train set. \n",

    "In the performance assessment, I saw an R-squared score indicating over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. MAE shows that the estimated ticket price can be within $9 or so of the real price, much better than the $19 from just using the average price. \n",
    "Then we imputed missing values with the mean, which performs similar to the one when we used the median for imputing missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize better results and avoid overfitting, I need to select the K best features. I defined a new pipeline and tried the SelectKBest defaults K =10 and later K =15. We saw the different R-squared scores on the two performances. However, we can’t just pick the model with the better test set because by trying the K with random numbers, we may end up with the test set of some used data. Therefore, we used cross-validation to see how the model performs on unseen data without touching the test set. The estimate of the variability in the performance is from 0.44 to 0.82, which is inconsistent with the test split.  \n",

    "Instead of repeatedly checking performance on the test split, we defined the pipeline to assess performance using cross-validation. We found out the test score is roughly from 0.55 to 0.85. Then using GridSearchCV hyperparameters feature, we found that the median is better than the mean for imputing the missing data, and scaling the features doesn’t help much. I also used the best_estimator_ to find out the test score is between 0.58-0.85, which improved slightly from the default CV result (0.55-0.85)\n",
